# Timsort

This is one of the best sorting algorithums up to my view beacuse it uses the mechanism of two sorting algorithums merge sort and the insertion sort here isnertion sort has the effectivity of using low constant rate. In this merge sort this is the fastest sorting algorithum for combining the two tapes and it has less time complexity.
